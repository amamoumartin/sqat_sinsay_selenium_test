# Software quality and testing - Selenium assignment

I completed the tasks for grade 3, 1 week late, so I'm planning to get a grade 2.
These are the completed tasks:
- Fill simple form and send (eg. Login)
- Form sending with user
- Logout
- Static Page test (cookies page)
- complex xpath (3+ times)
- Explicit wait
- Reading the page title
- Page object pattern
- BasePage object class
- WebDriver configuration (modify something in the browser options)
- Using configuration file
